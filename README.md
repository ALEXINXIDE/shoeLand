## Project Structure

The project structure consists of three main components:

- **HTML**: The HTML file (`index.html`) defines the structure and content of the landing page. It includes the header, navigation, product images, and footer sections.

- **CSS**: The CSS file (`styles.css`) contains the styling rules for the entire webpage. It covers layout, fonts, colors, and animations.

- **JavaScript**: The JavaScript file (`main.js`) is responsible for handling user interactions and changing the content dynamically when users click on different shoe variants.

## Styling

The CSS (styles.css) file is used for styling the landing page. Some key styling points include:

- Overall page layout is responsive, with a fixed navigation menu and flexible content sections.
- The navigation menu is fixed at the top of the page and includes links to different sections of the site.
- The header section features a product image and a brief description with a call-to-action button.
- Various animations and transitions are used to create interactive elements, like the product variants and buttons.
- The footer section is styled with a dark background and includes links to different site sections and company information.

## JavaScript Functionality

The JavaScript (main.js) file adds dynamic functionality to the landing page. It handles the following features:

- It defines different shoe variants, each with specific colors, product images, and button styles.
- Clicking on a variant updates the page's color scheme, product image, logo, button style, and activates the chosen variant.
- The product images section is updated with images corresponding to the selected variant.
- The code ensures that the website remains interactive and responsive when users select different shoe variants.

This landing page is designed to provide an engaging user experience and showcases how JavaScript can be used to make web pages interactive and dynamic.
